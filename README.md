# personal_site
This personal site that I made has three pages on it.
The home page has a quote on it from lex fridman, and what my own goal is from learning web development.
The about me page has a brief little background of me and a few of the things I do for fun.
The portfolio page is where I currently am with my projects from this class and hope to add more into it as well.
All work was done through vs code html, css, and javascript.
