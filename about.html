            <p>In my free time I like using Procreate on my iPad and follow YouTube tutorials to make small design projects. I hope to eventually be able to incorporate more of my own design work to add into website for people. </p>

            <p>I started getting into Kickboxing when I was about 17 and continued to do it well into my mid twenties then slowly mixed in Jiu-Jitsu. Boxing has become my stress reliever and a way to clear my mind when puzzled.</p>
